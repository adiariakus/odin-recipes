# odin-recipes

This is a basic recipes website instructed to do as a [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) in The Odin Project.

The idea is to learn how to: 
- Create a simple project from scratch
- Use HTML elements like lists, anchors and images
- Make commits
- Publish it to github pages
